# 🏠 Airbnb Clone – Use Case Diagram

## Overview

The **Use Case Diagram** illustrates how different user roles interact with the **Airbnb Clone backend system**. It defines the main actors—**Guest**, **Host**, and **Admin**—and outlines their key interactions with the system’s core functionalities, including user authentication, property management, booking, payment processing, reviews, and messaging.

## System Actors and Functionalities

* **Guest**: Can register, log in, search for properties, make bookings, complete payments, leave reviews, and send or receive messages.
* **Host**: Can create, edit, or delete property listings, view bookings for their properties, and communicate with guests.
* **Admin**: Oversees system operations by managing users, monitoring listings, and ensuring compliance with platform standards.
<!--
Each actor interacts with the system boundary through use cases that represent specific backend-supported features. Relationships such as `«include»` and `«extend»` indicate how functionalities depend on or build upon one another—for example, *Make Booking* includes *Make Payment*, while *Write Review* extends *View Booking History*.

It supports the design of backend modules, API endpoints, and access control mechanisms by establishing the foundation for system requirements and user interactions. The Use Case Diagram serves as both a planning and communication tool, aligning developers and stakeholders on the system’s intended behavior.
