# üèóÔ∏è Airbnb Clone ‚Äì System Architecture and Module Dependency Diagram


## Overview
This document presents the **System Architecture and Module Dependency Diagram** for the Airbnb Clone backend. The diagram illustrates how core modules such as **User Authentication**, **Property Management**, **Booking System**, **Payment Processing**, and **Review & Messaging Systems** interact within the platform. It serves as both a **technical map** and a **functional overview**, outlining the logical flow of user actions and system dependencies that power the Airbnb-like experience.

## Structure and Flow
At the foundation of the architecture is the **User Authentication module**, which governs secure access through registration, login, and role-based control. Every subsequent interaction in the system‚Äîwhether browsing properties, booking accommodations, or leaving reviews‚Äîdepends on successful authentication.  

Once authenticated:
- **Guests** can browse and filter properties, initiate bookings, and complete payments.  
- **Hosts** can create, edit, and manage their listings, and respond to guest inquiries.  

The **Property Management module** connects users to listings, while the **Booking System** manages reservation logic‚Äîverifying availability, handling date conflicts, and linking to payment workflows. The **Payment Processing module** ensures secure transactions, integrating with third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to confirm or refund payments.  

After successful stays, guests can submit ratings and comments through the **Review System**, and both parties can communicate via the **Messaging System**. Arrows in the diagram represent **dependencies and user interaction flows**, indicating the sequence of operations and the relationships between modules.

## Purpose
This architecture diagram provides a **clear visual representation of backend logic and data flow**, enabling developers to understand system dependencies and integration points. It ensures consistent implementation of authentication, data validation, and transaction integrity across all modules.
