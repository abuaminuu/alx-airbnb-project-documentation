Perfect üëç ‚Äî this task is about writing a **formal backend requirement specification** in Markdown (`.md`), focusing on **how each major feature works technically** ‚Äî APIs, data flow, validation, and performance expectations.

Here‚Äôs a ready-to-use, **well-structured `requirements.md` file** for your **Airbnb Clone Backend Features**.
It covers **four major modules** (User Authentication, Property Management, Booking System, and Audit & Logging).

# üß© Airbnb Clone ‚Äì Backend Requirement Specifications

## üìò Overview
This document outlines the **functional and technical requirements** for the backend components of the Airbnb Clone system.  
Each section details the expected behavior, API endpoints, data inputs and outputs, validation rules, and performance criteria.  
The goal is to ensure consistent backend development, integration, and testing practices.

    "password": "Secret123!",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  }
````

* **Output (Success):**

  ```json
  {
    "message": "Registration successful",
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "token": "jwt_token_string"
  }
  ```

### **Validation Rules**

* Email must be valid and unique.
* Password must be at least 8 characters, with upper/lowercase and a number.
* All fields required on registration.

### **Performance Criteria**

* Average response time ‚â§ 200ms.
* Token verification time ‚â§ 100ms.
* Use caching for authenticated sessions.

## 2. üè† Property Management

### **Objective**

Enable hosts to create, update, and delete property listings.

### **API Endpoints**

| Method   | Endpoint              | Description                                     |
| -------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/api/properties`     | Create new property listing                     |
| `GET`    | `/api/properties/:id` | Retrieve property details                       |
| `PUT`    | `/api/properties/:id` | Update property information                     |
| `DELETE` | `/api/properties/:id` | Remove property listing                         |
| `GET`    | `/api/properties`     | Retrieve all properties (paginated, filterable) |

### **Input / Output Example**

* **Input (Create Property):**

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Ocean View Apartment",
    "description": "Spacious 2-bedroom apartment near the beach.",
    "location": "Lagos, Nigeria",
    "price_per_night": 25000.00,
    "host_id": "uuid"
  }
  ```
* **Output:**

  ```json
  {
    "property_id": "uuid",
    "message": "Property created successfully"
  }
  ```

### **Validation Rules**

* Name, description, location, and price are mandatory.
* Price must be greater than zero.
* Only hosts can create or update properties.

### **Performance Criteria**

* Database writes < 500ms.
* Read operations < 300ms.
* Pagination returns max 20 items per request.

## 3. üè® Booking System

### **Objective**

Allow users to book available properties for specific dates and handle availability.

### **API Endpoints**

| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                 |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/api/bookings`            | Create a booking            |
| `GET`  | `/api/bookings/:id`        | Retrieve booking details    |
| `PUT`  | `/api/bookings/:id/cancel` | Cancel an existing booking  |
| `GET`  | `/api/bookings/user/:id`   | Get all bookings for a user |

### **Input / Output Example**

* **Input (Create Booking):**

  ```json
  {
    "property_id": "uuid",
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "start_date": "2025-06-01",
    "end_date": "2025-06-05"
  }
  ```
* **Output (Success):**

  ```json
  {
    "booking_id": "uuid",
    "status": "confirmed",
    "total_price": 100000.00
  }
  ```

### **Validation Rules**

* Property must exist and be available for the selected dates.
* End date must be after start date.
* Total price calculated as `(nights √ó price_per_night)`.

### **Performance Criteria**

  * Status code
  * User ID

### **Performance Criteria**

* Logging must not exceed 5% of total request processing time.
* Logs must be retrievable within 2 seconds for admin reports.
* Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) must **never** be logged.

## ‚úÖ Summary

These specifications ensure that the backend supports secure authentication, efficient property management, reliable booking operations, and comprehensive system logging.
Each feature aligns with RESTful design standards and performance best practices, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and auditability of the system.

```

Would you like me to extend this file to include **Payment Processing** and **Review & Messaging** modules too (so your repo meets full feature coverage for grading)?
