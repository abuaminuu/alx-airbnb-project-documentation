# üß© Airbnb Clone ‚Äì Backend Requirement Specifications

## üìò Overview
This document outlines the **functional and technical requirements** for the backend of the **Airbnb Clone** project.  
It defines how the backend handles user authentication, property management, bookings, payments, reviews, messaging, and system logging.  
Each section details API endpoints, input/output formats, validation rules, and performance expectations.

---

## 1. üîê User Authentication
**Objective:** Manage secure user registration, authentication, and profile retrieval.

### **Endpoints**

| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate user and issue JWT |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/profile` | Retrieve authenticated user details |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/logout` | Invalidate active session |

### **Validation Rules**
- Password must contain ‚â• 8 characters, with at least one uppercase letter, lowercase letter, and number.  
- Email must be unique and valid.  
- Token expiration: 24 hours.

### **Performance Criteria**
- Response time ‚â§ 200ms average.  
- 99.9% authentication success rate for valid credentials.

## 2. üè† Property Management
**Objective:** Allow hosts to create and manage property listings.

### **Endpoints**

| `DELETE` | `/api/properties/:id` | Delete property |
| `GET` | `/api/properties` | List or filter all properties |

### **Validation Rules**
- Only verified hosts can create or modify listings.  
- Required fields: `name`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`.  
- `price_per_night` must be greater than zero.

### **Performance Criteria**
- Read operations ‚â§ 300ms.  
- Write operations ‚â§ 500ms.  

---

## 3. üè® Booking System
**Objective:** Enable guests to book available properties and manage reservations.

### **Endpoints**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/bookings` | Create a booking |
| `GET` | `/api/bookings/:id` | Retrieve booking details |
| `PUT` | `/api/bookings/:id/cancel` | Cancel an existing booking |
| `GET` | `/api/bookings/user/:id` | List bookings made by a user |

### **Validation Rules**
- Booking dates must not overlap existing bookings.  
- `end_date` must be greater than `start_date`.  
- Total price = `price_per_night √ó nights`.  

### **Performance Criteria**
- Availability check ‚â§ 200ms.  
- Booking confirmation ‚â§ 500ms.

## 4. üí≥ Payment Processing
**Objective:** Process payments securely and maintain transaction records.

### **Endpoints**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/payments/initialize` | Initialize payment for booking |
| `POST` | `/api/payments/verify` | Verify transaction status |
| `GET` | `/api/payments/user/:id` | Retrieve payment history by user |

### **Input Example**
```json
{
  "booking_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "amount": 150000.00,
  "payment_method": "card"
}
````

### **Validation Rules**

* Must reference a valid, active booking.
* Transaction IDs must be unique.
* Sensitive information must be encrypted.

### **Performance Criteria**

* Payment initiation ‚â§ 300ms.
* Third-party verification ‚â§ 2s.

## 5. ‚≠ê Review System

**Objective:** Allow users to rate and review properties after completed stays.

### **Endpoints**

| Method   | Endpoint                    | Description                        |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/api/reviews`              | Submit a new review                |
| `GET`    | `/api/reviews/property/:id` | Retrieve reviews for a property    |
| `DELETE` | `/api/reviews/:id`          | Delete review (by author or admin) |

### **Input Example**

```json
{
  "property_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "rating": 4.8,
  "comment": "Lovely space and very responsive host!"
}
```

### **Validation Rules**

* Rating must be between 1.0 and 5.0.
* Only users with completed bookings may post reviews.
* Comments limited to 1000 characters.

### **Performance Criteria**

* Review submission ‚â§ 250ms.
* Aggregated rating updates ‚â§ 500ms.

## 6. üí¨ Messaging System

**Objective:** Facilitate secure messaging between hosts and guests.

### **Endpoints**

| Method   | Endpoint                         | Description                    |

## 7. üßæ Audit & Logging (Admin)

**Objective:** Maintain detailed logs for transparency, monitoring, and debugging.

### **Logging Requirements**

* Log every API request with:

  * Timestamp
  * User ID (if available)
  * Endpoint & HTTP method
  * Status code
  * Response time (ms)

### **Admin Controls**

* Admin can query logs by:

  * User ID, endpoint, date range, or status code.

### **Performance Criteria**

* Logging overhead ‚â§ 5% of total request time.
* Log retrieval ‚â§ 2s.
* Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) excluded.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This specification provides a complete guide for backend development of the **Airbnb Clone** project.
It defines RESTful API endpoints, input/output formats, validation rules, and measurable performance criteria to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability across all features.

Would you like me to follow up with a **system architecture diagram** (showing how these modules interact with the database, API gateway, and external services like payments)? It would complement this `requirements.md` nicely.
